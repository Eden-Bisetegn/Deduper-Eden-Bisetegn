1. Define the problem 

Our initial SAM file has PCR duplicates and we are trying to generate a script to 
remove PCR based duplicated by passing it through diffrent conditionals and unit 
testing our output file.


## sort SAM file using samtools 

uniqe reads={}  #initalize a dictionary for uniqe reads
observed UMI=[]

#assingn the names of the diffrent columens so its easier to refer to 

Qname= SAM col 1   #will extract UMI using a function
flag= SAM col 2
RNAME= SAM col 3
POS= SAM col 4   # cheak pos accounting for soft clipping
Cigar = SAM col 6        #cheak for soft clipping 

open and read file line by line:
    parse the SAM line(readline, split and strip)
    cheak if mapped 
    if((flag & 256) != 256):
        if((flag & 4) != 4):
            pass
        else:
            pass
    Cigar string # write a function and call
*** Extract the umi from the Qname  # write a function 
    
    if UMI not is observed UMI # if the umi in the file not in our set of known UMI's
        add to set and to dictionary as key

with open output SAM file:
    if known umi is in dictionary
        write to file 
    else:
        pass
