1. Define the problem 

Our initial SAM file has PCR duplicates and we are trying to generate a script to 
remove PCR based duplicated by passing it through diffrent conditionals and unit 
testing our output file.


## sort SAM file using samtools 

mapped reads={}  #initalize a dictionary for mapped reads

#assingn the names of the diffrent columens so its easier to refer to 
Qname= SAM col 1   #will extract UMI using a function
flag= SAM col 2
RNAME= SAM col 3
POS= SAM col 4   # cheak pos accounting for soft clipping
Cigar = SAM col 6        #cheak for soft clipping 

open and read file line by line:
    parse the SAM line(readline, split and strip)
    cheak if mapped 
    if((flag & 256) != 256):
                if((flag & 4) != 4):
                    place in dictionary as a key
                else:
                    pass
    Cigar string # write a function and call
    extract the umi from the Qname
    
with open output SAM file:
    if known umi is in dictionary
        write to file 
    else:
        pass



    functions 

def parse_cigar :
    cstring = []
    length = ""
    for char in cigar_string:
        if char.isdigit():
            length += char
        else:
            operations.append((int(length), char))
            length = ""
    return operations

def extract umi from Qname
    ````will formulate````

def cheak for POS accounting for UMI
